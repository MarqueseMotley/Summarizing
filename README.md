# Summarizing
This Kusto Query Language (KQL) script is designed to summarize the most recent protection and threat information for each device in a network. By using the arg_max() function, the query retrieves the latest ThreatStatus, ProtectionStatus, and TypeofProtection for each device based on the TimeGenerated timestamp. This allows for efficient real-time monitoring of multiple devices, ensuring that I can quickly identify any devices that are currently at risk or unprotected. This method is essential for keeping a network secure and responding promptly to threats.<img width="1195" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 12 47 24 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83fcf689-dc11-492b-b8c4-6542fbba7f92">

This Kusto Query Language (KQL) query is designed to retrieve the most recent protection and threat information for each device in the network and identify how long it has been since each device last reported a protection status. By calculating the time difference between the current time and the last generated log, the query helps detect devices that may not be actively reporting their security status. It sorts devices by this time difference, allowing for quick identification of potential gaps in security monitoring. This is essential for ensuring that all devices are actively protected and their security statuses are up-to-date.
